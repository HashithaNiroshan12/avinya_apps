# Backends for Frontends (BFFs)
All the backend for frontend (BFF) components would live here. A BFF is a REST API written in the Ballerina programming language in this application stack. The BFF would consume the Global Data API, a GraphQL API, and in turn, expose a REST API to the front end. 
Each folder here represents a component within the Campus domain related to the operations within an Avinya Acadamy campus.
