# Frontend Application 

The Avinya App front end lives here. This application is written in Flutter Dart and implements the Gallery App pattern. The root application would allow the user to log in, and then based on the user's role, the application would enable the sub-applications as a set of gallery of widgets for the user. 

## Running on command line locally
